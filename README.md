# Exploring Subsidized Housing Using Public Data

This project explores indicators for housing affordability in Chicago using publicly available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Zillow, and the Census Bureau to answer the following questions:

- What public data exists that can be used to develop indicators for housing affordability?

- Are the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâ€™s Fair Market Rent calculations representative of actual rents in Chicago?

- How have Fair Market Rent calculations and Zillow Observed Rent Index values changed over the period of 2014 to 2019 in Chicago?

- Do socio-economic characteristics such as rent burden, gini index values, and educational attainment have an association with housing affordability?
