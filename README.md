# To Do

- Expand on the definition of "Adequate housing is an important factor in a personâ€™s wellbeing."
- Research questions: 
  - Directionality of relationship between "actual rent" and "Fair Market rent"
- Data:
  - match Zillow data with hud data
    - Zori data has monthly while HUD is by year
    - only a limited number of zip codes have data for _all_ years
  - match Zip code and Census track for eviction data
